      # The Kubernetes scheduler’s default behavior works well for most cases
      # -- for example, it ensures that pods are only placed on nodes that have 
      # sufficient free resources, it ties to spread pods from the same set 
      # (ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, etc.) across nodes, it tries to balance out 
      # the resource utilization of nodes, etc.
      #
      # But sometimes you want to control how your pods are scheduled. For example,
      # perhaps you want to ensure that certain pods only schedule on nodes with 
      # specialized hardware, or you want to co-locate services that communicate 
      # frequently, or you want to dedicate a set of nodes to a particular set of 
      # users. Ultimately, you know much more about how your applications should be
      # scheduled and deployed than Kubernetes ever will.
      #
      # “taints and tolerations,” allows you to mark (“taint”) a node so that no 
      # pods can schedule onto it unless a pod explicitly “tolerates” the taint.
      # toleration  is particularly useful for situations where most pods in 
      # the cluster should avoid scheduling onto the node. In our case we want
      # node-exporter to run on master node also i.e, we want to collect metrics 
      # from master node. That's why tolerations added.
      # if removed master's node metrics can't be scrapped by prometheus.

        # of /var/lib/docker
        # running cAdvisor in a container; use a hostPath of /dev/cgroups
