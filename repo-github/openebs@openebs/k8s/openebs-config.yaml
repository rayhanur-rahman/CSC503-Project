# A storage admin (human) may want to manage storage resources manually. This 
# config file is expected to provide such option
#
# StoragePool : Is an instance of storage pool - i.e.
#  - a directory on host-os, or
#  - a directory on mounted-disk, 
#
# Define a storage pool for launching the replicas using
#  local directory or mounted directory on kubernetes nodes
#  
# The following is an example of how a storagepool can be 
# confgured with any other directory to be used for persisting 
# the storage. 
#
# Note: OpenEBS uses /var/openebs as default directory, even if 
# the following default storagepool is not added to the k8s cluster.
