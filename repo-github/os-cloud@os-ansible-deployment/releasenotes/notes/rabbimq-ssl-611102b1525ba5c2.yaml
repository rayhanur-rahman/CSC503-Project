  - OpenStack services have been set to communicate with RabbitMQ using SSL by
    default. This feature may be disabled by setting ``rabbit_use_ssl`` to
    ``false`` in ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml``. The default
    behaviour will be to use a self-signed certificate for communications. This
    can be changed by the procedure referred to in
    `the SSL documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/install-guide/configure-sslcertificates.html>`_.
