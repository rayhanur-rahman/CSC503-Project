  - Ironic-Staging-Drivers can now be installed. These are
    drivers that are not included in the ironic repo, and
    provide additional hardware support for ironic. More
    information about the drivers can be found at
    `Ironic-Staging-Drivers <https://opendev.org/x/ironic-staging-drivers>`_
    To install the staging drivers set `staging_drivers_include`
    to true. The default value is false.
