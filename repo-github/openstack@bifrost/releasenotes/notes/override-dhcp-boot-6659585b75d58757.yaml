    Allows ``undionly.kpxe`` boot option to be overridden.

    As an operator, I may wish to provide DHCP boot options for hosts not
    managed by bifrost using the bifrost dnsmasq server.

    Previously, if a ``dhcp-boot`` configuration option was provided to dnsmasq
    via a file in ``/etc/dnsmasq.d/``, and the server was not booted via iPXE,
    the option would have been overridden by the ``undionly.kpxe`` option added
    by bifrost in ``/etc/dnsmasq.conf``.

    Bifrost now supports user-provided ``dhcp-boot`` options in
    ``/etc/dnsmasq.d``. These should be specified with an appropriate set of
    tags to match against to ensure that the rule overrides the default rule
    configured by bifrost.
