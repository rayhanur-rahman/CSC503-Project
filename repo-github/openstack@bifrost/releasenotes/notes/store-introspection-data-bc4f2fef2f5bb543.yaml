    Stores introspection data in nginx.

    In the absence of swift, we can now use the bifrost nginx web server -
    masquerading as an object store - to store raw and processed introspection
    data for nodes.  This is configured via the boolean variable
    ``inspector_store_data_in_nginx`` and is enabled by default.
