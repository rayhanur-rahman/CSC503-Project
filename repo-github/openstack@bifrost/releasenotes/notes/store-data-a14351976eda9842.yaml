features:
  - |
    When inspection support is enabled, introspection data is now stored in
    the database by default. You can use the ``ironic-inspector-migrate-data``
    command to move the data from nginx to the database, for example::

        ironic-inspector-migrate-data --from swift --to database --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``inspector_store_data_in_nginx`` configuration option is deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. Introspection data can now be
    stored in the database.
