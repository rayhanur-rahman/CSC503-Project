    During the Ocata cycle, a number of improvements have been made to bifrost
    to improve the managability and longevity of a bifrost installation.
    Coupled with a number of fixes, and improvements, users upgrading should
    take the time to read the entire release notes. A few highlights are below:

        * Bifrost now installs and utilizes Ansible 2.1 by default from
          PyPI.
        * Ironic's default of modifying a pre-existing ironic.conf upon the
          installation being re-executed, has been changed to a utilize a
          template file.
        * Bifrost supports generating and reading from a os-client-config
          ``clouds.yaml`` file for obtaining credentials.
        * Bifrost can now leverage authentiation, as well as install and
          configure keystone if requested by the installer.
        * As a number of in-tree drivers in ironic were removed this past
          cycle, due to lack of third-party CI, support has been added to
          enable installation of the staging drivers repository.
