    By adding extra string variable ``-e public_ip=8.8.8.8``
    which is to be used in conjunction with ``use_public_urls=true``
    Bifrost, if used with Keystone enabled, will configure
    public services endpoints (for Keystone, Ironic and Ironic
    Inspector) to contain this public IP address in replacement
    of the default values which are set to point to localhost.

    The default behaviour is kept unchanged, which means that
    services public endpoints will contain references to
    localhost aka 127.0.0.1.
