features:
  - |
    Bifrost's testing has been moved to use JSON-formatted baremetal inventory
    file instead of deprecated CSV-formatted one.
    The ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` role still accepts ``baremetal_csv_file``
    variable as path to where to write inventory, but the file content will
    always be in JSON format.
    A new variable ``baremetal_json_file`` should instead be used
    as a location to where to write the test baremetal inventory file.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``baremetal_csv_file`` variable in ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` role
    has been deprecated and will be removed in the Queens release.
    The inventory file written to this location by this role is now always
    in JSON format.
    The variable ``baremetal_json_file`` should be used instead of
    ``baremetal_csv_file``.
    This concerns only those operators who run tests for bifrost on
    virtual hardware using ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` role and out-of-tree
    scripts to process the baremetal inventory file produced by this role.
    If such scripts do rely on this file being in CSV format,
    they must be updated to use JSON format instead.
deprecations:
  - |
    The CSV format for baremetal inventory file is deprecated and using
    it will be impossible in the Queens release.
    During deprecation period it's handling is still supported by bifrost's
    dynamic inventory, but this functionality will be removed in the Queens
    release.
