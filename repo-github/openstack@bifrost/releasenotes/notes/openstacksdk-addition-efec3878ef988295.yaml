    Adds the use of the ``openstacksdk`` library which is superceeding the
    ``shade`` library for communicating with OpenStack services using the
    Ansible modules. By default this will attempted to be installed
    from source. Set the ``openstacksdk_source_install`` option to false
    in order to install from PyPI.
