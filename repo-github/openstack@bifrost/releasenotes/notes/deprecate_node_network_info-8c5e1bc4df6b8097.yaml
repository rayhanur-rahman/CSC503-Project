deprecations:
  - The ``node_network_info`` parameter has been deperecated
    in favor of the ``node_network_data`` parameter as the
    related configuration drive ``network_info.json`` file was
    misnamed originally, and should have been named
    ``network_data.json``.
    Support for the node_network_info, and the continued
    write-out of the network_info.json file in configuration
    drives will be removed in the Queens cycle.
fixes:
  - When support for passing configuration drive data to the
    nodes was originally created, the file was accidently named
    incorrectly as ``network_info.json``.  The correct filename
    is ``network_data.json``. Both files will now be written
    until support for writing ``network_info.json`` is removed
    in the Queens cycle.
