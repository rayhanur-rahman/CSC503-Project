    By adding extra string variable ``-e private_ip=8.8.8.8``
    Bifrost, if used with Keystone enabled, will configure
    private/internal services endpoints (for Keystone, Ironic and Ironic
    Inspector) to contain this private IP address in replacement
    of the default values which are set to point to localhost.

    The default behaviour is kept unchanged, which means that
    services private endpoints will contain references to
    localhost aka 127.0.0.1.
