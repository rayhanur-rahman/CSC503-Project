features:
  - Adds support for tweaking the vCPU model for the VMs created
    by bifrost-create-vm-nodes. The default vCPU model is ``host-model``
    which should provide the best possible performance whilst using only
    the CPU features which are understood by libvirt. The model can be
    changed using the ``test_vm_cpu`` Ansible variable.
