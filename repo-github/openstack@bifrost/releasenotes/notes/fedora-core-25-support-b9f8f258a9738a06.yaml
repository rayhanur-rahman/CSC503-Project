features:
  - |
    Adds support for Fedora 25, 26, and 27.
upgrades:
  - The location for the tftp master_images cache folder has
    changed from ``/tftpboot/master_images`` to
    ``/var/lib/ironic/master_images``. This was done due to
    security enhancements in Fedora that break the ironic-conductor
    process as-architected.
fixes:
  - |
    Addresses issues with setuptools on various distributions
    such as Centos 7.3 and Fedora 25 where the shipped version
    is too old to build the python packages.
  - |
    Changes the application of SELinux security policy from using
    the command line tools to leveraging the Ansible module which
    addresses issues with newer version of Ansible on Fedora.
deprecates:
  - |
    Support for Fedora versions prior to Fedora Core 25, will be removed
    during the Rocky release cycle.
