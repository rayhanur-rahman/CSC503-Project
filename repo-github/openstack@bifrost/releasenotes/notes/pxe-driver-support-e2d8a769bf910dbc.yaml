features:
  - Support for PXE driver substrate is now installed
    which utilizes iSCSI to write the disk image to the
    target node. By default, this support is enabled.
upgrade:
  - PXE driver substrate support is now enabled by default.
    If a user wishes to prevent this, the ``enable_pxe_drivers``
    setting should be set to ``false``.
security:
  - PXE driver support substrate has been added, however
    this requires the ability for the conductor to connect
    to the node being provisioned via iSCSI. As a result
    sudoers configuration is updated by default to enable
    ironic to initiate the iSCSI connection and apply
    the image to the remote disk. As a reminder, users
    should default to using agent drivers as cleaning
    support does not exist in the PXE drivers.
fixes:
  - PXE driver support substrate was previously incomplete
    and has been revised to properly support PXE drivers.
    This has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
issues:
  - Basic testing has revealed that PXE drivers may not
    result in the configurtion drive being written out
    with the current configuration of bifrost.
