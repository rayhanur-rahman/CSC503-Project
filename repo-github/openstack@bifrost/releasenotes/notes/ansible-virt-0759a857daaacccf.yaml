features:
  - |
    Changes the ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` role to use Ansible's virt
    modules to create virtual machines for bifrost testing.
    This supersedes the embedded bash script to create virtual machines.
    As a result, all variables that were present in the bash script are
    now available as default role variables and can be overridden by standard
    Ansible means.

    For backward compatibility, some of the variables still support the
    use of shell variables, but this is deprecated and should be avoided.
deprecations:
  - |
    Relying on shell environment variables to set parameters for created
    virtual nodes is deprecated and will be removed in the Queens release.
    Any scripts relying on such behavior need to be changed to explicitly
    pass these parameters as extra-vars to ansible-playbook invocations.
