# This playbook is creating a permissive RBAC clusterrolebinding to make kubernetes
# run like v1.5 (pre RBAC - control) This workaround is giving developers time
# to adapt to 1.6, and then after a time we can remove and apply all fixes
# that will be done to support RBAC
#
# delete first is a workaround until kubernetes support apply clusterrolebinding
