upgrade:
  - The new config file layout requires a manual migration
    of overrides from the old to the new location.  Not
    performing this migration could cause some overrides
    to not be set and unknown behavior.

    The steps to do this are to run the migrate-yaml.py
    script and verify that the output is as you wish it to
    be to build your overrides files.  You are encouraged
    to put rpc specific overrides in
    `/etc/openstack-deploy/user_rpco_variables_overrides.yml`
    and the openstack-ansible overrides in
    `/etc/openstack-deploy/user_osa_variables_overrides.yml`

    The secrets files will need to be combined and
    migrated manually to
    `/etc/openstack_deploy/user_rpco_secrets.yml`
