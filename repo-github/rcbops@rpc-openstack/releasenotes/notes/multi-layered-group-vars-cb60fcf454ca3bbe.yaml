    RPC-O previously relied on user-space configuration files
    to set variables used in playbooks across both
    OpenStack-Ansible and RPC-O playbooks. These user-space
    configuration files provided global overrides only and
    could not be scoped to specific host groups. These defaults
    have now been set in group_vars in the code tree, reducing
    the need to overwrite user-space files, making them easier
    to scope to host groups, and reducing their precedence level
    to improve future development flexibility.
