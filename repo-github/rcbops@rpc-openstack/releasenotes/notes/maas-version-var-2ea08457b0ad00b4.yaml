features:
  - RPC-MaaS has been seperated out into it's own repo. This
    change allows maas to be developed outside of rpc and
    maintained as an OpenStack version agnostic deployment
    for all things monitoring.
  - A variable has been added to allow RPC-MaaS to locked
    down to a specific version of the repo as needed. This
    variable is ``maas_version`` which has a default of 
    "master".
