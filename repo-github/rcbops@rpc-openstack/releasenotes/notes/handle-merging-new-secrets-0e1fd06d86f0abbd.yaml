features:
  - The ``update-yaml.py`` script now contains an optional
    argument, ``--output-file``, for specifying an output
    file.
upgrade:
  - Any new secret variables that may be introduced in
    later releases are now handled by the ``update-secrets.sh``
    script. ``test-upgrade.sh`` and ``deploy.sh`` have been updated
    to use ``update-secrets.sh`` to handle any new variables
    that may be introduced in newer releases. If the deployer
    is not using these scripts for upgrades, then
    ``update-secrets.sh`` needs to be invoked manually. Please
    see official RPCO upgrade docs for usage.
fixes:
  - Secret variables defined in rpco specific variable
    files are now properly merged with any new secret
    variables that might be introduced in a subsequent
    release.
