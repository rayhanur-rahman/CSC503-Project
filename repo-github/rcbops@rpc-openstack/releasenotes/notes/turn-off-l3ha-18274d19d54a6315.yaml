    If upgrading from an environment that has L3HA on,
    please keep the following in mind:
    
    * HA routers, networks, and ports will linger.
      Manually deleting these resources could cause
      the router namespaces to disappear, which would
      in turn cause network downtime.

    For more information, see:
    `bug 1149 <https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/issues/1149>`_
    or the known issues section in the v13.0 RPCO documentation.
other:
  - Neutron L3HA as a default has been disabled. This has been done
    due to the number of bugs that still exist in that feature.
    The default now is to use the neutron_ha_tool for backing up
    l3 routers.
