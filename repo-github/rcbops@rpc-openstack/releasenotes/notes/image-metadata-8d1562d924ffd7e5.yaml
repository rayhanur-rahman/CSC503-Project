features:
  - Image metadata has been added to boost base image performance for the Images
    that we may provide to a customer deployment.
  - The metadata option `hw_scsi_model` is being passed into the images we
    provide by default and is set to **virtio_scsi**.  This option will
    improve IO performance on our default images. While not required, it is
    recommended that the **virtio_scsi** kernel module be loaded on the host for
    this change to have a functional benifit.
  - The metadata option `hw_vif_multiqueue_enabled` is being passed into the
    images we provide by default and is set to **true**.  This option will
    improve network performance on our default images when the guest OS has
    "multi-queuing" enabled. If the guest OS can not automatically understand
    "multi-queuing" enablment the user can run the following command to enable
    it within the guest `ethtool -L ${NIC} combined ${CPU_CORES}`.
  - The metadata option `hw_qemu_guest_agent` is being passsed into the images
    we provide by default and is set to "yes". This option will attempt to
    enable qemu guest agent which provides additional options to nova when
    managing the instance. While not required, it is recommended that the
    **virtio_net** kernel module be loaded on the host for this change to have a
    functional benifit.
