upgrade:
  - The HA policy for RabbitMQ is changed to replicate to two nodes,
    instead of three nodes, in order to increase performance and
    scalability of the RabbitMQ service. The override `rabbitmq_policies`
    set the new default value via the `group_vars/all/osa.yml`
    configuration.
    The replication count ideally resembles the number of RabbitMQ
    nodes necessary to maintain quorum (2 for 3 nodes, 3 for 5 nodes).
