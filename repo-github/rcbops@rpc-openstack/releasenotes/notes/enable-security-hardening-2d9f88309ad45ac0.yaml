    The `openstack-ansible-security role <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/>`_
    is now applied to all environments by default. It provides enhanced host
    security hardening without disrupting an existing OpenStack environment.

    To opt-out of host security hardening, set 'apply_security_hardening: false' in /etc/openstack_deploy/user_osa_variables_overrides.yml.

    The security role documentation explains which
    `security configurations are applied <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/controls.html>`_
    and `how to apply custom configurations <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible-security/configuration.html>`_.
