upgrade:
  - The ceph monitors and osds needs their configuration
    file to be updated for the Mitaka release, to adapt
    with the hostnames changes done in Mitaka. Please
    backup, destroy, and re-create the monitors, and
    make them rejoin the cluster in a serial way. The
    osds also need to have their configuration file
    updated.
  - When re-created during the upgrade procedure, the
    ceph monitors will now have bind mounts to the hosts.
    This will make the backup of the mons easier in the
    future.
