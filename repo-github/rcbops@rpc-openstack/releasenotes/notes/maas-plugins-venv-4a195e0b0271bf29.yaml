upgrade:
  - Deployers need to be aware of upgrading from a
    system that isn't running the maas plugins inside
    of a virtualenv. They need to decide if they want
    the maas plugins to continue to run on the global
    environment or a virtual environment.
fixes:
  - MaaS Plugins now run inside their own virtual
    environment
