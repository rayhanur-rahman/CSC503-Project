fixes:
  - Previously, the nova_cloud_stats maas plugin was
    incorrectly reporting total cpu and total memory
    amounts available across all hypervisors, as it was
    not taking into account the allocation_ratios that
    are set at the hypervisor level. Now, it attempts
    to correctly scale those values by passing in a
    multiplier based on the allocation ratios set in
    the config
