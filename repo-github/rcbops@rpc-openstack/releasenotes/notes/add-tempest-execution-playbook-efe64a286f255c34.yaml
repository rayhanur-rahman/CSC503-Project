    A new playbook has been introduced in the ``scripts/`` directory called
    ``run_tempest.yml``. This playbook will install tempest using the upstream
    OSA role, then execute the tempest tests defined in the sets enumerated
    in the ``tempest_test_sets`` variable.
  - |
    A new variable, ``tempest_test_sets`` has been added to
    group_vars/all/rpc-o.yml. This variable contains a space-delimited string
    of tempest test sets to execute when running the ``scripts/run_tempest.yml``
    playbook.
