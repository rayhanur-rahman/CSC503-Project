    OS-octavia was downlaoding its amphora image from the upstream
    daily master build - thus delaying the deploy for the duration
    of the downlaod and potentially using untested octavia versions.
    This patch deactivates the automatic download which might result
    in the deployer ghaving to uplaod the octavia amphora image to
    glance themselves.
