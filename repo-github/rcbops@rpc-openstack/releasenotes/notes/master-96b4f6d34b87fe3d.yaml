features:
  - Variables and secrets are now managed in a manner that
    allows downstream deployers to not have to worry about
    their settings being overwritten.  They are provided
    with overrides files that they alone manage after we
    lay them down.  We have also taken this time to rename
    our user_* files to separate out what specifically the
    variables override, whether it be upstream splitting
    the OSA relevant changed of the local RPC-O changes or
    local RPCO changes.
deprecations:
  - We are deprecating the use of user_variables and
    user_secrets files other than the ones found below.
