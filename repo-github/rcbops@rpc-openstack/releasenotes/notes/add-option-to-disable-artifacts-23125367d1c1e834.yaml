features:
  - The option to enable or disable artifacts has been added giving the
    deployer the ability to chose how artifacts will be consumed. Three new
    variables are now available to users, `apt_artifact_enabled`
    `container_artifact_enabled` `py_artifact_enabled` which are all
    **Boolean**. If a user defines any of variables it will used as the
    ultimate source of truth, even if artifacts are "found" for the given
    release.
  - Artifacted builds will save facts as an ansible local fact. If a deployer
    needs to expunge facts from our cached local facts the file
    `/etc/ansible/facts.d/rpc_openstack.fact` can be modified or removed as
    needed. All artifacted facts will be saved under the "rpc_artifacts"
    section.
