security:
  - Live migration of nova is now ssh encrypted, using
    qemu+ssh instead of qemu+tcp. This behavior can be
    overriden by setting another uri in the variable
    ``live_migration_uri``
other:
  - Due to the introduction of the new nova api db, the
    variables ``nova_api_db_max_overflow``,
    ``nova_api_db_max_pool_size`` and
    ``nova_api_db_pool_timeout`` were introduced.
    The tweaking of these variables can be done by
    overriding them directly (for an api db change only),
    or by adapting ``db_max_overflow``,
    ``db_max_pool_size`` and ``db_pool_timeout`` (for a
    global change)
