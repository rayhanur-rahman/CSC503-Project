    The configuration option ``ovs_integration_bridge`` used by networking-ovn
    metadata agent can only lead to problems as the bridge used by
    ``ovn-controller`` to install the flows is stored in OVSDB.
    The metadata agent will now use OVSDB instead of the configuration option
    to plug its ports, as a mismatch between both will break metadata.
    There is no real use case for this option to exist and systems currently
    using it will *not* be impacted by this change.
