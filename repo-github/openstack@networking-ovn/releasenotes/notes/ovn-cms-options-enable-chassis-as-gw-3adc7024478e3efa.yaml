    New option "enable-chassis-as-gw" to select gateway router.
    For external connectivity, gateway nodes have to set ovn-cms-options
    with enable-chassis-as-gw in Open_vSwitch table's external_ids column.

    $ovs-vsctl set open . external-ids:ovn-cms-options="enable-chassis-as-gw"

    Networking-ovn will parse ovn-cms-options and select this chassis
    if it has proper bridge mappings. This helps admin to exclude compute
    nodes to host gateway routers as they are more likely to be restarted
    for maintenance operations. If no chassis with enable-chassis-as-gw and
    proper bridge mappings available, then chassis with only bridge mappings
    are selected for scheduling router gateway.

    This is not a config option enabled through conf files. Instead admin
    has to set it through openstack installer or manually in Open_vSwitch
    table.
