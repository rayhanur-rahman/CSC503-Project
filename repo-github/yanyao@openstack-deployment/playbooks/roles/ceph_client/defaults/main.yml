# to user Ceph in OSA, you need to
# - have the needed pools and a client user (for glance, cinder and/or nova)
#   pre-provisioned in your ceph cluster; OSA assumes to have root access to
#   the monitor hosts
# - configure / overrules following defaults in osa's user config
# - some ceph specific vars are (also) part of other role defaults:
#   * glance
#   * nova
# - cinder gets configured with ceph if there are cinder backends defined with
#   the rbd driver (see openstack_user_config.yml.example)
