    Ubuntu has 4 different 'components' - main, universe, multiverse and
    restricted:

    * Main: Officially supported software.
    * Restricted: Supported software that is not available under a completely
      free license.
    * Universe: Community maintained software, i.e. not officially supported
      software.
    * Multiverse: Software that is not free.

    The default apt sources configuration uses all components. If deployers
    wish to change this to reduce the components configured then the variable
    ``lxc_container_template_apt_components`` may be set in
    ``/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`` with the full list of
    desired components.
