# Boolean option to implement OpenStack-Ansible configuration for an AIO
bootstrap_host_aio_config: yes

# Boolean option to implement OpenStack-CI LibVirt Configuration Changes
bootstrap_host_libvirt_config: no

## Swap memory
# If there is no swap memory present, the bootstrap will create a loopback disk
# for the purpose of having swap memory available. Swap is required for some of
# the services deployed and is useful for AIO's built with less than 16GB memory.
# By default the swap size is set to 8GB unless the host memory is less than 8GB,
# in which case it is set to 4GB.
bootstrap_host_swap_size: "{% if ansible_memory_mb['real']['total'] < 8*1024 %}4{% else %}8{% endif %}"

## Loopback volumes
# Sparse loopback disks are used for Cinder, Swift and Nova (instance storage).
# The size of the loopback volumes can be customized here (in gigabytes).
#
# Boolean option to deploy the loopback disk for Cinder
bootstrap_host_loopback_cinder: yes
# Size of the Cinder loopback disk in gigabytes (GB).
bootstrap_host_loopback_cinder_size: 1024
#
# Boolean option to deploy the loopback disk for Swift
bootstrap_host_loopback_swift: yes
# Size of the Swift loopback disk in gigabytes (GB).
bootstrap_host_loopback_swift_size: 1024
#
# Boolean option to deploy the loopback disk for Nova
bootstrap_host_loopback_nova: yes
# Size of the Nova loopback disk in gigabytes (GB).
bootstrap_host_loopback_nova_size: 1024

## Bridge configuration
# The AIO bootstrap configures bridges for use with the AIO deployment.
# By default, these bridges are configured to be independent of any physical
# interfaces, and they have their 'bridge_ports' set to 'none'.  However,
# deployers can add a physical interface to 'bridge_ports' to connect the
# bridge to a real physical interface.
#
# A setting of 'none' keeps the bridges as independent from physical
# interfaces (the default).
#
# Setting the value to 'eth1' would mean that the bridge is directly connected
# to the eth1 device.
#
# See https://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections for more details.
bootstrap_host_bridge_mgmt_ports: none
bootstrap_host_bridge_vxlan_ports: none
bootstrap_host_bridge_storage_ports: none

## Extra storage
# An AIO may optionally be built using a second storage device. If a
# secondary disk device to use is not specified, then the AIO will be
# built on any existing disk partitions.
#
# WARNING: The data on a secondary storage device specified here will
# be destroyed and repartitioned.
#
# Specify the secondary disk device to use.
#bootstrap_host_data_disk_device: vdb
#
# Boolean value to force the repartitioning of the secondary device.
bootstrap_host_data_disk_device_force: no
#
# If the storage capacity on this device is greater than or equal to this
# size (in GB), the bootstrap process will use it.
bootstrap_host_data_disk_min_size: 60

### MongoDB Settings
# MongoDB is installed on the host in the AIO for Ceilometer to use.
#
# Boolean value to deploy and configure the MongoDB service on the host.
bootstrap_host_mongodb_service: yes
#
# Boolean value to configure the required MongoDB users
bootstrap_host_mongodb_users: "{{ bootstrap_host_mongodb_service }}"
#
# Specify the IP address of a MongoDB Host.
bootstrap_host_mongodb_address: 172.29.236.100

### Optional Settings ###

# Set the apt repository URL's configured for the host and containers.
# By default the configuration will be derived from the host.
#bootstrap_host_ubuntu_repo: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
#bootstrap_host_ubuntu_security_repo: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

# Set the components that will be included in the apt repository configuration
bootstrap_host_apt_components:
  - main
  - universe

# Specify the public IP address for the host.
# By default the address will be set to the ipv4 address of the
# host's network interface that has the default route on it.
#bootstrap_host_public_address: 0.0.0.0
