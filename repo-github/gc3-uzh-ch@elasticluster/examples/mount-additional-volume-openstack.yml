# Provision a storage volume on an OpenStack cloud, attach it to the
# cluster's master/front-end node, and make it available under
# directory `/data`.  You need to edit this playbook to plug the
# correct values into the `vars:` section.
#
# This playbook should be run *after* ElastiCluster has set up the
# cluster, for instance using::
#
#         elasticluster setup mycluster -- /path/to/this/playbook.yml
