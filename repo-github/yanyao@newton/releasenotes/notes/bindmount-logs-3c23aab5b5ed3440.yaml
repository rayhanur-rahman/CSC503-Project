features:
  - Containers will now bind mount all logs to the physical host
    machine in the "/openstack/log/{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    location. This change will ensure containers using a block
    backed file system (lvm, zfs, bfrfs) do not run into issues
    with full file systems due to logging.
upgrade:
  - When upgrading deployers will need to ensure they have a
    backup of all logging from within the container prior to
    running the playbooks. If the logging node is present within
    the deployment all logs should already be sync'd with the
    logging server and no action is required. As a pre-step it's
    recommended that deployers clean up logging directories from
    within containers prior to running the playbooks. After the
    playbooks have run the bind mount will be in effect at
    "/var/log" which will mount over all previous log files and
    directories.
  - Due to a new bind mount at "/var/log" all containers will be
    restarted. This is a required restart. It is recommended that
    deployers run the container restarts in serial to not impact
    production workloads.
fixes:
  - Logging within the container has been bind mounted to the hosts
