# This is here because there was a different way of configuring SSL/TLS
# for RabbitMQ that used a mode of 0750 for the RabbitMQ directory.  That has
# since been updated but we need to ensure that old environments get this
# critical update during upgrades.

# See bug 1513668 in Launchpad for more details.
