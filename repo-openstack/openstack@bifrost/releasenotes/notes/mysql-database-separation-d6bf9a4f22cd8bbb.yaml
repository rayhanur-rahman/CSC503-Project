features:
  - |
    Bifrost now supports the definition of a specific database server,
    username, password, and database name for ironic and ironic-inspector.
  - |
    If the host for the database is not set to ``localhost``, then actions
    such as database and user creation are skipped. This functionality
    is present in both the bootstrapping for ironic, ironic-inspector, and
    keystone, and applies to initial explicit database schema creation steps
    where applicable.
deprecations:
  - |
    Use of the ``ironic_db_password`` variable as an available default will
    be removed in the Queens release of bifrost.
