features:
  - Downloaded IPA files can now be verified using checksum files.
    Upstream builds will be verified by default but you can disable
    this behavior by setting ``ipa_kernel_upstream_checksum_url`` or
    ``ipa_ramdisk_upstream_checksum_url`` variables to empty strings.
    The default checksum algorithm is ``sha256`` which matches
    the one provided in the upstream files. In case you want to
    provide your own checksum files, you can set the previously mentioned
    variables appropriately to match your setup. You can also set
    ``ipa_kernel_upstream_checksum_algo`` or ``ipa_ramdisk_upstream_checksum_algo``
    to checksum algorithms like ``md5`` in case you want to provide
    non-sha256 checksums. Be careful though because these values
    must be valid for Ansible ``get_url`` module's ``checksum``
    parameter. Finally, it's also possible to provide the checksum
    directly by setting the ``ipa_kernel_checksum`` or ``ipa_ramdisk_checksum``
    variables to ``$algorithm:$checksum``.
    In case the verification fails, bifrost will retry a few more times
    to re-download and re-verify the files before giving up assuming
    there is a network issue or a file corruption on the remote server.
