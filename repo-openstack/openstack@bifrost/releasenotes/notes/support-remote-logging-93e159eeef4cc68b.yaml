features:
  - Add support of remote logging. This feature allows to send logs
    from local syslog server and not collects logs from services on
    baremetal nodes. To collect from the actual running nodes requires
    configuration injected into each deployed host.
    Syslog server address and port can be specified in options
    ``remote_syslog_server`` and ``remote_syslog_port`` respectively.
