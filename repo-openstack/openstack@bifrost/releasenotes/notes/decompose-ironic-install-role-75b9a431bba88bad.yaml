  - The ironic install role has been split into 3 phases.
    ``install`` phase installs all ironic packages and
    dependencies. ``bootstrap`` phase generates configs
    and initializes the ironic db. ``start`` phase starts
    all ironic services and dependencies. Each phase is run
    by default and can be skipped by defining skip_package_install,
    skip_bootstrap and skip_start respectively.
