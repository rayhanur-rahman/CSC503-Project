features:
  - The capability for Bifrost to read directly from
    the os-client-config data has been added. While shade
    can do this for us to a degree, bifrost also allows
    a user to directly choose the server which they are
    connecting to via the ``ironic_url`` parameter.
    Instead of duplicate code and retool, if no global
    ``auth`` parameter is detected, the authentication
    parameters from the ``os_client_config`` module is
    utilized to set the parameters.
  - An optional parameter has been added to the roles
    that interact with ironic that defines a ``cloud_name``.
    This cloud name is utilized by the roles to determine
    the entry from os-client-config to utilize.
issues:
  - The addition of support for os-client-config does
    not allow a user to choose their ``cloud``
    directly. Only the first entry returned is utilized.
  - Log entries where authentication data is read and
    stored have been masked with the ``no_log`` parameter.
    Troubleshooting non-standard authentication configurations
    may require modifying the playbooks so users can debug their
    input OR pass data directly in a different way.
