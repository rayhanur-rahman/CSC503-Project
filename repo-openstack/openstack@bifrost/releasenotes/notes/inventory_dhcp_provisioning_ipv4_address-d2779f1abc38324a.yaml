    The inventory_dhcp feature permits configuration
    of dnsmasq to provide the IP configuration on
    servers deployed by Bifrost, rather than setting
    that information into the config drive.
    Previously, the feature assumed the IP set by
    dnsmasq was both the provisioning and the
    management IP, but on some scenarios that is
    not always the case.
    With the inclusion of the inventory_dhcp_static_ip
    option a user can provide an specific provisioning 
    IP via the JSON/YAML/CSV inventory in a server by
    server basis, which will be used just for the
    provisioning.
