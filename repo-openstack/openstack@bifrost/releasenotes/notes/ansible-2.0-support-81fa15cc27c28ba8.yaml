upgrade:
  - Bifrost has moved to focusing its use on Ansible 2.0.
    While Ansible 2.0 is relatively new, it has been stable
    development for quite some time. If a pre-existing user
    intends to reinstall/upgrade their environment, they may find
    the need to remove their pre-existing ansible environment
    located at ``/opt/stack/ansible``.
deprecations:
  - Moving forward, bifrost will be targeting use of
    Ansible 2.0. Due to some style/configuration changes,
    some roles have been marked in their metadata as being
    intended and only functional with Ansible 2.0 due to
    required features having been added in 2.0 that were
    not present or available to reproduce in a 1.9.x
    compatible way.
