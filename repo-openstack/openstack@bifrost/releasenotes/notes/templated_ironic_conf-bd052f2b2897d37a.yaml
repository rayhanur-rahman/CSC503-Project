features:
  - Ironic.conf is templated and only sets required
    options now, as opposed to editing the sample
    configuration of Ironic.
other:
  - In the past, the sample config in Ironic may have
    set some boilerplate that Bifrost took advantage
    of. But now that config is entirely made up of
    comments, and so this change does not change much
    except stripping out all of those comments and
    leaving just the required content in ironic.conf
    to use Ironic with Bifrost.
upgrade:
  - Upon installation, bifrost will replace the installed
    ironic.conf file with a template generated file.
    Custom setting changes to that file, which were previously
    retained, will now be lost upon re-installation.
