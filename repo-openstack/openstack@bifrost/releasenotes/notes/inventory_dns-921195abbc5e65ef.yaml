features:
  - Adds new feature to manage DNS with the settings
    on the inventory. When ``inventory_dns`` setting is
    True, it will populate a set of record-host entries,
    for each of the hostnames present on the inventory,
    matching the ``ipv4_address``.  This will override
    the default dnsmasq behaviour, that will associate
    hostnames with IP present on the leases file.
