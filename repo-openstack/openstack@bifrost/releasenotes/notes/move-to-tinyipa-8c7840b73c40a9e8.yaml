upgrade:
  - Bifrost has changed to using TinyIPA as the default
    IPA image for testing. TinyIPA has a smaller footprint
    for downloads and memory utilization. Users can continue
    to utilize CoreOS or diskimage-builder based IPA images,
    however this was done to improve testing performance and
    reliability.
    If the pre-existing IPA image is removed, bifrost will
    automatically re-download the file upon being updated
    in an installation process.  Otherwise, the pre-existing
    IPA image will be utilized.
