features:
  - Allow to populate the domain setting of
    dnsmasq. As shown in documentation, this is optional,
    but if it is set, it does the following things.
    1) Allows DHCP hosts to have fully qualified domain
    names, as long as the domain part matches this setting.
    2) Sets the "domain" DHCP option thereby potentially
    setting the domain of all systems configured by DHCP.
    3) Provides the domain part for "expand-hosts"
other:
  - The role will accept the ``domain`` setting. If that's
    present, it will be populated to equivalent domain
    setting in dnsmasq.conf
