features:
  - |
    Bifrost has removed support for Ironic's SSH based power and management
    drivers, as a result of Ironic removing the drivers altogether.

    Bifrost testing has moved to ``ipmitools``-based ironic drivers and
    virtual hardware exposed via 'virtualbmc' utility.

    Default ironic drivers set up by bifrost are changed to
    ``pxe_ipmitool`` and ``agent_ipmitool``.

    Default driver for CSV baremetal data files in bifrost's dynamic inventory
    is changed to ``agent_ipmitool``.
  - |
    Moves all preparation for testing with 'virtual' hardware to the
    ``bifrost-create-vm-nodes`` role, and libvirt interactions have
    been decoupled from the ``bifrost-ironic-install`` role.
upgrade:
  - |
    Default ironic drivers set up by bifrost are changed to
    ``pxe_ipmitool`` and ``agent_ipmitool``.

  - |
    Default driver for CSV baremetal data files in bifrost's dynamic inventory
    is changed to ``agent_ipmitool``.
    Those bifrost users relying on such behavior must explicitly set the
    driver in CSV baremetal data file.
deprecations:
  - |
    Handling of ``*_ssh`` drivers for CSV baremetal data format has
    been removed as the drivers have been removed from ironic.
