    Allows log directories to be configured

    In some cases it is useful to be able to configure the directory into which
    log files are written by bifrost services.

    It is now possible to configure the ironic, inspector and nginx log
    directories using the ``ironic_log_dir``, ``inspector_log_dir``, and
    ``nginx_log_dir`` variables respectively.
