  - A new playbook was added to redeploy nodes.
    The playbook transitions each node's provision state
    to 'available', waiting for the nodes to reach
    that state.  Next, the playbook deploys the
    nodes, waiting for the nodes to reach provision
    state 'active'.  The playbook is redeploy-dynamic.yaml
    in the playbooks directory.
