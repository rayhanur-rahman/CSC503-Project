    By adding extra boolean variable ``-e use_public_urls=true``
    Bifrost, if used with Keystone enabled, will configure
    public services endpoints (for Keystone, Ironic and Ironic
    Inspector) to contain the public IP address of the node
    where Bifrost is running in replacement of the default
    values which are set to point to localhost.

    The default behaviour is kept unchanged, which means that
    services public endpoints will contain references to
    localhost aka 127.0.0.1.
