    By adding extra variable ``-e ipa_upstream_release=stable-mitaka`` for instance,
    the deployment can now use all ramdisk and kernel images available in
    https://tarballs.openstack.org/ironic-python-agent/tinyipa/files/
    instead of the default ``master``.

    Furthermore, as some of these files do not have any .sha256
    checksum associated to them, the downloading of these file
    is now just issuing a "warning" and is not reported as an
    Ansible error in the final summary.
