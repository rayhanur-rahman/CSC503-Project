  - bifrost host dependencies are now being installed using the
    ``bindep`` tool. New dependencies should be added to the bindep.txt
    file with the appropriate profile information if necessary. Core
    dependencies (ie those needed to bootstrap the system such as python,
    gcc, libffi, etc) must be listed in both the bindep.txt file and the
    scripts/install-deps.sh one for mainly two reasons. First of all, the
    OpenStack CI may only consult the bindep.txt in order to pull the
    necessary dependencies. Second, ``bindep`` needs certain packages to
    be present in order to its dependencies to build properly.
