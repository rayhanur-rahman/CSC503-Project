features:
  - Allows to choose to leverage authentication with roles that
    interact with ironic services via ansible modules. This is
    limited to sessions that obtain authentication information
    via os-client-config. The role defaults ultimately remain
    unchanged and default to noauth mode.  More information on
    os-client-config can be found at
    https://docs.openstack.org/developer/os-client-config/
issues:
  - Users wishing to utilize authentication without leveraging
    os-client-config, will need to manually update the playbooks
    in order to set the appropriate module settings.
