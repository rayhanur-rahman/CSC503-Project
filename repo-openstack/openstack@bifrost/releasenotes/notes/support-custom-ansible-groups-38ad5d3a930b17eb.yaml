    It is now possible to define additional per-host inventory
    groups for all the hosts that make use of the dynamic JSON
    inventory. The way to do that is to simply define a
    list of groups in the `host_group` property as illustrated
    in the following example:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        "node1": {
            "uuid": "a8cb6624-0d9f-c882-affc-046ebb96ec01",
            "host_groups": [
                "baremetal"
            ],
        }


    When provisioning virtual machines it's possible to set
    the per-VM inventory groups by setting the ``test_vm_host_groups``
    variable as follows::

        { test_vm_host_groups: { testhost: [nova, cinder] } }

    It is also possible to change the default ``baremetal`` group
    for virtual machines by simply setting the ``host_default_group``
    variable to a list of default groups as follows::

        { test_vm_default_groups: [baremetal vms] }

    The list of default groups can also be set in the
    ``DEFAULT_HOST_GROUPS`` environmental variable. This is currently
    the only way to change the default group for baremetal hosts::

        export DEFAULT_HOST_GROUPS="foo bar zoo"

    This will change the default groups to [foo, bar, zoo] instead of
    the currently [baremetal] default. Extra care should be taken when
    using this method since most bifrost playbooks depend on having a
    [baremetal] group available for provisioning hosts.
