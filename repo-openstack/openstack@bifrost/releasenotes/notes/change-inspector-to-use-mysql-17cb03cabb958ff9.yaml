upgrade:
  - Ironic inspector has been switched to using MySQL as
    its back-end database. This was to correct a bug that
    functionally broke inspection.
fixes:
  - A bug in file ownership resulted in the ironic-inspector
    functionality not working as expected, and the test being
    unable to be re-executed without manual clean-up. This has
    been corrected by moving the database use to MySQL.
