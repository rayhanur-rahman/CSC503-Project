features:
  - |
    The ``bifrost-keystone-client-config`` role can now write a
    ``clouds.yaml`` file with several clouds settings. It starts to
    accept a single compound variable ``clouds`` that must contain a
    dictionary describing key:value pairs in the format of
    ``<cloud-name>:<dict-of-cloud-settings>``.
    The previous way of passing ``config_*`` vars to the role is supported for
    backward compatibility but is deprecated and should be expected to be
    removed in Pike.

    In addition to previous ``bifrost`` cloud, the default ``install.yaml``
    playbook now also writes ``bifrost-admin`` cloud settings that contain
    Keystone admin credentials so that when installed, the Keystone service
    is fully usable right away (users/projects etc can be managed).

deprecations:
  - |
    Passing ``config_*`` variables defining credentials for ``bifrost``
    cloud to the ``bifrost-keystone-client-config`` role has been deprecated,
    and will be removed in the Pike cycle.
    Instead a single compound variable named ``clouds`` defining sets of
    settings to be written to ``clouds.yaml`` should be passed to that role.
