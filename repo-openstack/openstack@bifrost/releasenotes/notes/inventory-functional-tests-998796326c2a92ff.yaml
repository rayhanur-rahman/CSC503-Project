fixes:
  - Functional tests were added for the inventory module
    that leverage JSON and YAML parsing to ensure that the
    input is same as the expected output of the conversion
    being leveraged.
  - A functional test was added that reconsumes JSON data
    generated by the CSV file format to help identify any
    logic parity breaks between the logic present in each
    data parsing method.
