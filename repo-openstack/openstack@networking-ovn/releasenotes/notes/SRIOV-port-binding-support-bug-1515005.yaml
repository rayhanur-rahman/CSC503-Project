prelude: >
    support for binding a SR-IOV port in a networking-ovn
    deployment.
features:
    - networking-ovn ML2 mechanism driver now supports binding
      of direct(SR-IOV) ports. Traffic Control(TC) hardware
      offload framework for SR-IOV VFs was introduced in Linux
      kernel 4.8. Open vSwitch(OVS) 2.8 supports offloading OVS
      datapath rules using the TC framework. By using OVS version
      2.8 and Linux kernel >= 4.8, a SR-IOV VF can be controlled
      via Openflow control plane.
