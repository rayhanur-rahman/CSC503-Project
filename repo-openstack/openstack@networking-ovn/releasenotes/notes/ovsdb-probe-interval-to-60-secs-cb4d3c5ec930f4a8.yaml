upgrade:
  - |
    The ovsdb_probe_interval configuration option was changed from
    0 (disabled) to 60 seconds.
fixes:
  - |
    In a HA environment, when OVSDB server fails over to a different
    controller, the connection change is not detected by neither
    neutron-server nor ovn-metadata-agent. In order to fix this issue,
    a 60 seconds interval probe (by default) is now sent by OVSDB
    server clients.
