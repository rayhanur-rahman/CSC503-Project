# Set the available build targets for all nodes within an environment.
# build targets are grouped based on operating system and CPU
# architecture.
#
# This is the data structure used to determine the build host.
# venv_build_targets:
#   {
#     ansible_distribution_version: {
#       ansible_architecture: inventory_hostname
#     }
#   }
#
# Auto generation process:
# * The automatic build targets will iterate over the group name
#   "repo_all" and if any target is found it will catagorize it
#   using the distro and cpu architecture criteria.
# * If no group named "repo_all" is found the current inventory
#   hostname will be used as the only available build target.
# * If no build target is found for matching the distro and cpu
#   criteria of the active inventory item, the generator will fall
#   back to using the active inventory host as the build target.
#
# NOTE: (cloudnull): While there may be multiple inventory items
#                    that match a single distro and CPU architecture
#                    type, only one build target will ever be used.
#                    To make more than one build target effective,
#                    deployers should be using a shared file system
#                    for the repo servers.
