    An experimental provider of an openstack static inventory and SSH config.
    Is a feature for advanced dev/QE setups, like pre-provisioned VMs on
    OpenStack clouds (deployed-servers) or a split-stack. It has yet been
    tested by TripleO CI jobs. Eventually, we'll add a CI job and switch some
    of the OVB jobs in order to start testing this mode as well.

    In order to enable the feature for the 'tripleo-inventory' role, define
    `inventory: openstack`.
