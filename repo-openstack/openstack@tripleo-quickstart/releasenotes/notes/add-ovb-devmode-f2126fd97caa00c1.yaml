    Added functionality to run OVB deployments from
    devmode.sh - including options to remove old stacks
    and keypairs from the host cloud environment, include
    DLRN changes, and deploy in custom host cloud
    environments.
    Added two new switches to devmode.sh,
    --ovb (runs devmode through the OVB workflow)
    --delete-all-stacks (removes stacks and key pairs in the
    host cloud environment)
