features:
  - Configuration files in general_config were separated
    into feature sets (to be specified with --config
    argument )and nodes configuration (to be specified with
    --nodes configuration)
    Featureset files should contain only the list of flags
    that enable features we want to test in the deployment,
    the overcloud nodes configuration, and all that involves
    their set up, should be put into nodes configuration
    files.
    The nodes file should follow the scheme
    N<type>[_N<type>[_N<type>]...].yml
    Where N is the number of nodes of a certain <type>,
    <type> could be one of ctlr for controllers, comp for
    compute nodes, ceph for ceph nodes, and so on.
    It's advised to add a node_count variable to the nodes
    configuration file
deprecations:
  - All old configuration files are deprecated. Any new
    configuration should put the topology part into nodes/
    dir and the part that configures the features to be
    tested into featureset files. For example, the old
    minimal.yml file was split into no_netiso.yml and
    1ctlr_1comp.yml
