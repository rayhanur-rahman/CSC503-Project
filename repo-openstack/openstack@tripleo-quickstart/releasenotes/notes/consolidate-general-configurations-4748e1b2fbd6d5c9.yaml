features:
  - update the config/general_config/minimal.yml and config/general_config/pacemaker.yml
    configuration files to more closely match what is executed upstream.
deprecations:
  - The configurations that be default did not use containers for releases that
    supported containers ( pike++ ) are now deprecrated.  Specifically the
    configuration file in tripleo-quickstart-extras config/general_config/containers_minimal.yml
    and config/general_config/containers_undercloud_minimal.yml are deprecrated.
