    Tags were added in all the playbooks so that it is possible to control
    atomically the flow of the entire process.
    The *DEFAULT_OPT_TAGS* variable used in quickstart.sh has been changed to
    reflect all the available tags, which are *untagged*, *provision*,
    *environment*, *libvirt*, *undercloud-inventory*, *overcloud-scripts*,
    *undercloud-install* and *undercloud-post-install*.
deprecations:
  - |
    The old tag named *undercloud-scripts* has been replaced with the more
    self-explaining *undercloud-inventory*.
