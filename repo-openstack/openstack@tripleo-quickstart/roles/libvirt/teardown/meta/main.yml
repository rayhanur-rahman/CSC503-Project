# Include settings from the libvirt role, and include all the
# `teardown/*` roles.  This means that when your playbook has:
#
#     roles:
#       - libvirt/teardown
#
# You also get:
#
# - `libvirt/teardown/nodes`
# - `libvirt/teardown/user`
dependencies:
  - role: libvirt
  - role: teardown/nodes
  - role: teardown/user
