# This layered system specific config loading pattern alllows us to minimize
# configuration changes by defining var in optimal location. Each more
# specific config file can override variables from previous ones. Keep in mind
# that dictionaries are not combined, as this allows us to remove elements.
#
# vars/redhat.yml          <-- all RedHat distros
# vars/redhat-8.yml        <-- would be loaded by RHEL & CentOS 8
# vars/centos.yml
# vars/centos-7.yml
# vars/centos-7-6.yml      <-- good for a specific config override
# vars/centos-7-6-1810.yml <-- very unlikely but posible
